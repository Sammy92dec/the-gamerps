Rock, Paper, or Scissors - This game has been played for ages its fantastic that we can have it digitalised. Mostly it's played with two people but with this game, it will be Player vs Computer. How it works is  Rock always beats Scissors, Scissors always beat Paper, and Paper always beat Rock. A straightforward game in which you do not need a lot of practice. With this project, I practiced Javascript including also my HTML and CSS skills. </a>

For the purpose to show my knowledge in JavaScript, by creating a popular games.

### <a id="structure"></a>Structure

I aimed for a simple website that should contain as little clicks as possible.It have few coding compared with my first project.Adding mouse lisner to make it reponsive.

### <a id="skeleton"></a>Skeleton
The website is this designed as it it looks simple and clear.For the wireframe I used pen and paper to help me with my planning.It doesn't look like the sketch but evolved to how it looks now.

1. HTML - To create a basic site
2. CSS - To create the pages beauty with colors and some edits on the header texts and the aligmennt of the whole page

### Future Implementations
being able to have score history with Players names.

### Accessibility

For the accessibility this was used:
- Semantic HTML.
- Alt attributes on images
- Sufficient colour contrast.

## <a id="testing"></a>Testing

In contrast to the first project. I continuously tested the code along to with coding to make sure everything is ok.

Some things that come up is to add a header to each section in the html code. But I later changed the sections and just had one header added.

The CSS Validator gave me two errors. One that I had forgot to write a unit on a margin. And the second one was that I had typed "position; bottom;"
which I changed to "position; fixed;".

I also used Lighthouse in Chrome to find ways to increase the accessibility of the website.<br>

</ul>

Other than the validators. I've been using the Inspect view in Google Crome using different layout for different devices and a lot with the responsive layout.
I also tested the website through my iPhone.
I've tested the website on a PC using Chrome and Edge web browsers.
Also, my mentor has tried the website.
